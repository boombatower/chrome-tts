# chrome-tts

Simple Chrome extension that utilizes `chrome.tts` API to read selection.

After the demise of my favorite TTS extension I decided to roll my own. This extension is very simple and does not offer a lot of frills, but it works and does not have silly limitations.

## options

The voice and rate can be configured in the extension options.

## additional voices

Additional voices may be installed via extensions. For example search the chrome web store for `US English Female Text-to-speech (by Google)` and then reload the extension options and select the voice.
